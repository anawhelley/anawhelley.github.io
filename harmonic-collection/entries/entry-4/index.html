  <p> Dada was an art movement formed during the First World War in Zurich
     in negative reaction to the horrors and folly of the war. The art, poetry
     and performance produced by dada artists is often satirical and nonsensical
      in nature Dada artists felt the war called into question every aspect of
      a society capable of starting and then prolonging it – including its art.
      Their aim was to destroy traditional values in art and to create a new art
      to replace the old. As the artist Hans Arp later wrote: <br><br>Revolted by
      the butchery of the 1914 World War, we in Zurich devoted ourselves to
      the arts. While the guns rumbled in the distance, we sang, painted, made
      collages and wrote poems with all our might.<br><br>In addition to being
      anti-war, dada was also anti-bourgeois and had political affinities with
      the radical left.<br><br>The founder of dada was a writer, Hugo Ball. In 1916
      he started a satirical night-club in Zurich, the Cabaret Voltaire, and
      a magazine which, wrote Ball, ‘will bear the name ”Dada”. Dada, Dada,
      Dada, Dada.’ This was the first of many dada publications. Dada became
      an international movement and eventually formed the basis of surrealism
      in Paris after the war.<br><br>Leading artists associated with it include Arp,
      Marcel Duchamp, Francis Picabia and Kurt Schwitters. Duchamp’s questioning
       of the fundamentals of Western art had a profound subsequent influence.
