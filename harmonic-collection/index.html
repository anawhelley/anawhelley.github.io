<h1>ABOUT THE COLLECTION</h1>
<div class="word">
  <p> For my harmonic collection I wanted to continue doing more research into
    art history. Although I am enrolled in multiple art history courses, there
    is always so much more to learn. I have found that a majority of my peers,
    being that we are completing digital work, are not interested in the
    history of our majors. However, that does not include all of the communication
    design majors. Many are invested in learning more about each art movement
    and how it took form. That is why I wanted to form my code around a theme
    that I could also learn from.
