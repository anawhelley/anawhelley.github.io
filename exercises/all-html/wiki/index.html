    <p>Rainbow Kitten Surprise was formed in 2013 by Ela Melo and Darrick Keller.
      The two wrote and composed music together as they attended Appalachian State
      University. The band name was created by a friend who was on a morphine drip
      at the time, recently out of surgery.[2] Their first EP, Mary, was recorded
      in a dorm room at the university.[3] They later added three new members,
      Ethan Goodpaster, Jess Haney, and Charlie Holt. RKS independently released
      its first album, Seven, which was later re-released together with the
      band's first EP as a joint album called Seven + Mary. RKS initially recorded
      its music under the Split Rail Records label, a student run label at
      Appalachian State University's Hayes School of Music, where three of the
      band's members attended.[4] From 2014 through 2017, Rainbow Kitten Surprise
      has performed at multiple music festivals and other events, including Bonnaroo
      Music and Arts Festival and Austin City Limits Festival.</p>
